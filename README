tlsd - a TLS daemon
===================
TLSd is a daemon that both accepts and initiates TLS connections, runs
processes, and provides peer certificate's fingerprint as an
environment variable for them. The intent is to facilitate creation
and usage of simple services for peer-to-peer networking.


Examples
--------
An echo server on a random port:

    $ tlsd -e cat

Authentication:

    $ tlsd -p 5556 -- sh -c 'echo "Hello, ${SHA256}! I am a ${SIDE}."'

Connection initiation:

    $ echo 'localhost 5600' | tlsd -e echo 'hello'

Per-connection FIFO pairs:

    $ tlsd -p 5601 -e -- std2fifo -e ~/.chat/


Installation
------------
Dependencies: GnuTLS. To install from a tarball distribution:

    $ ./configure && make && make install

It uses GNU Build System, so the standard options and targets are
present.

Generated files are not included into the DVCS repository. To generate
them, use:

    $ aclocal && autoconf && autoheader && automake --add-missing

X.509 certificates can be generated with GnuTLS's certtool or
OpenSSL's req command.


Documentation
-------------
An info manual and man pages are provided.
